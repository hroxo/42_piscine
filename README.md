## ⚠️ Disclaimer  

Feel free to browse my code — it might give you ideas or help you debug.  
But please **don’t just copy-paste**. That’s the fastest way to *not* learn anything during the Piscine. Struggle, fail, try again… that’s the real magic of 42.

## ✨ Final Thoughts  

I didn’t finish all Projects, but it gave me:  
- A solid foundation in C  
- A new way of thinking about problems
- The opportunity to join common core!!!

Would I do it again? Absolutely.
